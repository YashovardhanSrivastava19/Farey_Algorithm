# Farey_Algorithm
One of the algorithm for giving rational approximation of irrational numbers.
Farey Algorithm gives the approximate fractional representation of irrational numbers.It continuously divides the number line (for a certain number of iterations) to find
the appximate decimal expansion for a supposed irrational number.The function might halt after certain number of iterations.

-> Suggestions and Improvements are always welcome.
